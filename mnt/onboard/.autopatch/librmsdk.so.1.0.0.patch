#
# The long paragraph bug has since been fixed in the current firmware. However
# this patch also has the side effect of disabling widows/orphans processing.
# (So now enabling it has the same effect as setting orphans:1; widows:1; in
# the stylesheet of all epub books, i.e. it prevents those extra blank lines
# being added to the bottom of some pages.)
