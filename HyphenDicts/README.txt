Move the HyphenDicts to .addons/hyphendicts/ so you can edit,
disable (by renaming or deleting), or add your own additional dicts for 
other languages (but no guarantee that Kobo will actually use them).

To uninstall this mod create .addons/hyphendicts/uninstall.
It will be renamed to uninstalled-date.

Note that uninstall will not restore the original dicts.
You get those with every firmware update.
