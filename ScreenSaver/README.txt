This mod displays a random PNG image on sleep/poweroff.

You can put your images in the .addons/screensaver folder.

The image must be in PNG format, extension .png (lower case).
Not too many files in total (at most 1000 or so, short filenames are better).

The mod can be uninstalled by creating ".addons/screensaver/uninstall"
